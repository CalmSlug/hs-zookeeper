# Zookeeper

Zookeeper is a prototype tool for monitoring animals at the local zoo.
It asks its user to input habitat number and prints out what is going on inside that habitat.

1st project done at hyperskill.org during Python training course.
Initial version was used to pass the final check at the website.
Later version has better input clarity and program structure.
